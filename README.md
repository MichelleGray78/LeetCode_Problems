Solving leetcode problems
## EASY
* AverageSalary: Working out the average salary excluding min and max
* countOdds: Count odd numbers in an interval range
* twoSum: Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
* ContainsDuplicate: Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, else return False.
* MergeSortedArray: You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively. Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.
* Maximum Subarray: Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.
* Binary_Search: Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.
* Search_Insert_Position: Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.
* sorted_squares: Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.
* rotate_array: Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.
