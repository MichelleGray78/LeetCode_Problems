Solving leetcode problems
* AverageSalary: Working out the average salary excluding min and max (EASY)
* countOdds: Count odd numbers in an interval range (EASY)
* longestPalSub: Work out the longest palendromic substring (DIFFICULT) - (SOLVED using MANACHERS ALGORITHM)
* twoSum: Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target (EASY).
* ContainsDuplicate: Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, else return False (EASY).
* MergeSortedArray: You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively. Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order (EASY).
* Maximum Subarray: Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum (EASY).
* Binary_Search: Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1 (EASY).
